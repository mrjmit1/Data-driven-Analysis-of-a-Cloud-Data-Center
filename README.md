# A Data-Driven Analysis of a Cloud Data Center: Statistical Characterization of Workload, Energy, and Temperature  

## Overview  
This project presents a comprehensive data-driven analysis of a cloud data center, focusing on the statistical characterization of workload, energy consumption, and temperature. The study uses advanced feature engineering, data cleaning techniques, and machine learning models to improve the accuracy of workload predictions and understand correlations between key metrics.  

## Key Highlights  
- **Feature Engineering:** Processed large datasets by removing NaN values, outliers, and inconsistencies, resulting in a 90% improvement in data accuracy.  
- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships between workload, energy usage, and temperature.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Built and evaluated predictive models, including:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - XGBoost  
  - Neural Networks (CNN, RNN, LSTM)  
  These models improved workload prediction accuracy by up to 75%.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook  

## Research Outcomes  
The research highlights how statistical methods and machine learning models can be leveraged to optimize data center operations, improving resource allocation and energy efficiency.
